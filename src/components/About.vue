            I used to work as a sound engineer. But one way or another, I came across
            programming, though I considered it too difficult to start WEB developing.
            I created my first simple landing pages in
            <span class="font-medium">WordPress</span> and native
            <span class="font-medium">HTML</span> +
            <span class="font-medium">CSS</span>. But then I came up with the idea of
            making the websites more interactive. And started learning
            <span class="font-medium">JS</span> with
            <span class="font-medium">Jquery</span>. It seemed to be just another way
            of self-development until I realized that I was really into programming.
            So, my hobby has become my new profession. And I really hope to become a
            good full-stack developer. Now I have started to study
            <span class="underline">BE</span> technologies.
            <span class="font-medium">Node.js</span> +
            <span class="font-medium">Nest.js</span> +
            <span class="font-medium">AWS</span>.
